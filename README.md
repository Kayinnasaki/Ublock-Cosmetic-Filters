# Ublock-Cosmetic-Filters
Mostly me fighting against annoying twitter changes. To use these, go to your ublock settings, go to filter lists, hit import and include the links you want.

## TwitterDeBlue.txt
Removes the theme colored names (blue with default twitter) in notifications. Really garish.

## TwitterWarningRemover.txt
Twitter's content sensetivity warning is a great feature that infuriatingly can't be turned off. This removes the feature entirely. Mostly for people who are sick of clicking every NSFW image.
