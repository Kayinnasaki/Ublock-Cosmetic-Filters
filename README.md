# Ublock-Cosmetic-Filters
Mostly me fighting against annoying twitter changes. To use these, go to your ublock settings, go to filter lists, hit import and include the links you want.

Also just wanted to say: I'm bad at this stuff, but I'm stubborn. Things will be wrong, or break, or be done assbackward. So if you know more than me, which is likely, please, by all means, put in a pull request or file a bug report.

## TwitterDeBlue.txt
Repurposing to remove the Twitter Blue Sidebar entry

## TwitterNoAnalytics.txt
Hopefully this is just a dumb test but twitter put the analytics button where the reply to yourself button is and I make way more threads than I check meaningless stats, so goodbye button. Kills the viewcount on every post of your timeline too

## TwitterNoDownVote.txt (*obsolete)*
Meanwhile this feature totally sucks and is basically to get you to moderate rich influencers tweets by... pushing toxic responses lower?? Just fucking block people jfc
why is it in the "like tweet" spot??? Anyways this removes it!

## TwitterNoViewCount.txt
Specifically for under tweets. This shit is useless, junk information, brought to you by the days of geocities. Less intrusive than other changes. See NoAnalytics to kill it on your timeline too.

## TwitterNoExplore.txt
Does anyone actually use this?? Removes the explore tab from the sidebar so I stop fucking accidentally clicking it

## TwitterNoVerified.txt
Removes the Verified tab in notifactions and, in the future, any other wierd "Verified" tabs. Because who wants to treat people special just cause they spent money?

## TwitterReducedSiderbar.txt
Removes the trending topics and recommended users sidebars from twitter because Fuck That shit

## TwitterWarningRemover.txt
Twitter's content sensetivity warning is a great feature that infuriatingly can't be turned off. This removes the feature entirely. Mostly for people who are sick of clicking every NSFW image.

# Just Gimme a Minimal Twitter Experience
Cool, copy and paste all of these into ublock! Be careful, things like WarningRemover aren't for everyone.
