# Ublock-Cosmetic-Filters
Mostly me fighting against annoying twitter changes. To use these, go to your ublock settings, go to filter lists, hit import and include the links you want.

## TwitterDeBlue.txt
Removes the theme colored names (blue with default twitter) in notifications. Really garish.

## TwitterWarningRemover.txt
Twitter's content sensetivity warning is a great feature that infuriatingly can't be turned off. This removes the feature entirely. Mostly for people who are sick of clicking every NSFW image.

## TwitterNoDownVote.txt
Meanwhile this feature totally sucks and is basically to get you to moderate rich influencers tweets by... pushing toxic responses lower?? Just fucking block people jfc
why is it in the "like tweet" spot??? Anyways this removes it!
